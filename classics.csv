Switch to the add_classics branch if you're not already on it.
Create a new file called classics.csv at the root of the project and copy/paste the following content into it:
title, director, year
One Crazy Summer, Savage Steve Holland, 1986
The Princess Bride, Rob Reiner, 1987
The Goonies, Richard Donner, 1985
The Breakfast Club, John Hughes, 1985
Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Terry Gilliam, 1975
Stage and commit the new file. The commit message should start with D:, in the same format as the previous exercises.
Run git log to make sure everything looks as you'd expect.
Run and submit the CLI tests from the branch you're on (should be add_classics).
You should be able to see which commits each branch tip points to in the log output. The main branch should point to commit "C" which should be right before your most recent commit "D" that add_classics points to.
Willow, Ron Howard, 1988
Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock, 1960
